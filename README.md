## Google Fiber call center case study. A Google Business Intelligence project

Client: Google Fiber (fictional scenario)



Google Fiber provides people and businesses with fiber optic internet. Currently, the customer service team working in their call centers answers calls from customers in their established service areas.  

​

Our client, the Google Fiber call center, wanted to explore trends in repeat calls to reduce the number of times customers must call in order for an issue to be resolved. I aim to highlight trends by showcasing a dashboard which provides insights into repeat caller volumes in different markets and the types of problems they represent. The insights could explore why customers have to call repeatedly and how to improve the overall customer experience and operational optimization.
