## Google Fiber call center case study. A Google Business Intelligence project

Client: Google Fiber (fictional scenario)



Google Fiber provides people and businesses with fiber optic internet. Currently, the customer service team working in their call centers answers calls from customers in their established service areas.  

​

Our client, the Google Fiber call center, wanted to explore trends in repeat calls to reduce the number of times customers must call in order for an issue to be resolved. I aim to highlight trends by showcasing a dashboard which provides insights into repeat caller volumes in different markets and the types of problems they represent. The insights could explore why customers have to call repeatedly and how to improve the overall customer experience and operational optimization.

​

Stakeholder Requirements:

     Chart or table showcasing repeat calls by week, month, and quarter

     Chart or table measuring repeat calls by first contact date

     Chart or table exploring repeat calls by problem type

     Chart or table exploring repeat calls by market

     Dashboard should explain what type of issues customers call back for 

     Dashboard should explain trends in different markets based on issue type
